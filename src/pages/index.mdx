# TLDR;
I'm a dedicated husband and father, a technology enthusiast, and a leader who thrives on solving complex problems. I've embarked on a professional journey that spans various roles, from mainframe developer to a technology director, always embracing the spirit of continuous improvement.

My personality, defined as INTJ-A, signifies my analytical and reflective nature, emphasizing practicality and insight. My leadership philosophy revolves around the values of extreme ownership, teamwork, and a relentless pursuit of growth, guided by a mission to provide unwavering support for my family and a vision to help them reach their full potential. Books play a crucial role in my life, steering me toward leadership and growth, and I've honed the skill of learning from audiobooks while multitasking. I carry the wisdom from these books and countless quotes as beacons of guidance in my journey, always striving to be better than the day before.
