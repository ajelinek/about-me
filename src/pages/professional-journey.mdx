# My Professional Journey
My professional journey began in a somewhat unexpected manner. I received the call to join State Farm to code PL/I without quite knowing what PL/I or the mainframe was. This was a humble start to a career that would eventually lead me to where I am today.

## Mainframe Developer 
My early days at State Farm revolved around mainframe development. I had the privilege of working with COBOL, JCL, and other mainframe technologies. It was a world of green screens, batch processes, and online systems that seemed to be stuck in time. But it was during these foundational years that I began to develop an appreciation for data and efficiency in data access. SQL became a second language to me as I explored more effective ways of accessing data.

My path at State Farm was anything but conventional. I volunteered to learn Java development to address data access issues in our distributed programs. Little did I know that this step would lead to a world of continuous learning and modern programming languages. Unlike the mainframe, where things remained relatively unchanged for years, the world of distributed programming was dynamic, constantly evolving, and filled with opportunities for growth.

## Technical Platform and PostgreSQL
I later had the opportunity to participate in setting up a new technical platform. My role in this endeavor focused on the enablement of PostgreSQL, and I embarked on the ambitious task of achieving a multimaster setup. This experience marked a significant period of intense learning and growth.

Transitioning to the Integrated Development Group (iDG) introduced me to agile methodologies and continuous delivery practices. I became part of cross-functional teams, embracing the dynamic and ever-changing landscape of software development. This phase marked my commitment to continuous improvement and the adoption of agile practices.

## Seeking Leadership
I reached a point in my career where I realized it was time to shift my focus towards leadership development. This transition was pivotal and marked the first and only time I actively sought a new opportunity. While I cherished my role as a developer in iDG, where I worked on both data and backend development, I was determined to step into a leadership role. This pursuit led me to the position of Test Automation Lead.

As the Test Automation Lead, I embarked on a journey to transform our approach to continuous delivery. I can still recall the moment when I proclaimed that we needed to deliver at the speed of business. Back then, it took us over six months to a year to move from workstation to production. Over the years, across various roles and departments, I continued to address this challenge, ultimately achieving faster delivery times. We now have teams that can deploy to production in a matter of minutes.

## System Architect and ITIL Practices
My career then transitioned to the role of System Architect and ITIL Practices. In this capacity, I addressed continuous delivery from a process-oriented perspective. Building on my experiences in test automation, I played a role in process transformation. I contributed to our agile transformation and the shift from project to product, which marked a significant cultural shift, granting teams greater autonomy and ownership, thereby enhancing morale and speeding up time to market. After the transformation, I moved from an individual contributor role in architecture to become a Technology Manager.

## Technology Manager and Enterprise DevOps Enablement
Transitioning from ITIL Practices, I assumed the role of Technology Manager with a focus on Enterprise DevOps Enablement. This marked a significant shift in my career, as I began to manage the tools and technologies that powered the DevOps processes across the organization. In this role, I ventured into the intricate world of multiple vendor relationships, overseeing multimillion-dollar contracts, and supporting the raw infrastructure that drove our software delivery pipelines.

My responsibilities extended to enabling development teams by implementing and optimizing tools such as GitLab, Jenkins, NIQS, and Checkmarx. The goal was to empower thousands of developers to deliver high-quality software more efficiently. Through automation, we tackled enterprise risks and compliance issues within the DevOps environment.

## AWS Enablement and Data Management 
A pivotal phase in my journey was my involvement in AWS Enablement for our Property and Casualty delivery area, where I played a role in driving the adoption of the AWS platform. This shift was essential, as the on-premise architecture would not scale to meet the modernization needs of our business. 

My journey further evolved into AWS Data Enablement, where I delved into the intricate world of enterprise data management. This phase emphasized the importance of data in our modern business landscape. I worked on and was responsible for our overall data architecutre which included but was not limited to; canonical data models, data validation, data consumption, data curation, and schema management.  This is where I learned the true power of data and how it can be used to drive our business forward.

## Transition to Technology Director
My journey took a transformative turn as I transitioned to the role of Technology Director. This transition was both a challenge and an opportunity. It marked a shift to a higher level of leadership, where I was entrusted with a holistic view of the delivery lifecycle, from ideation to deployment. The role of a Technology Director required not only technical expertise but also a keen understanding of strategic leadership.

As a Technology Director, my responsibilities extended to providing leadership to a diverse team. I had to set strategic direction, oversee complex projects, and ensure alignment with the broader organizational goals. The role demanded a focus on cultivating high-performing teams and fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

## Continuing the Journey
My commitment to driving positive organizational change remained unwavering. I dedicated significant time to maturing our product practices and instilling a mindset of continuous improvement. It was during this phase that I realized the significance of nurturing leaders rather than just managing processes. My journey was not solely about technological advancements but about inspiring and empowering individuals to reach their fullest potential, which is something I aspire to do better every day.

In my current role, I am entrusted with Enterprise Data Enablement, where I focus on enabling data platforms and ensuring the seamless flow of data for analytics and advanced data consumption. It's an exciting phase of my journey, where the fusion of technology, leadership, and continuous improvement continues to drive my passion for creating positive change.
