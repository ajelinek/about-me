# Personal Mission & Vision

In the journey of life, it's remarkably simple to become entangled in the hustle and distractions, losing sight of what truly matters. Influential leaders and motivational figures have consistently emphasized the importance of defining a clear mission and vision for one's life. On a lengthy drive home following my attendance at a Dave Ramsey conference, an event my wife and I visited in support of her financial coaching business, and where I had the privilege of hearing John Maxwell speak, I felt compelled to pause, reflect, and articulate my personal mission and vision. This was my attempt to discover the elusive power of purpose they spoke about.

So, here's my personal mission and vision, a work in progress, reflecting what matters most in my life. It inspires me to strive for continuous self-improvement and fulfillment, aspiring to be better every day. 

## Mission Statement
"My mission is to be fully present in every moment of my life. I'm committed to never-ending spiritual, personal, and professional growth. I aim to support and inspire my family, lead through faith and values, prioritize health and wellness, make a lasting impact through entrepreneurship, and contribute to the growth of those around me."

## Vision
"My vision is to serve as a steadfast spiritual leader, guide, and pillar for my wife, Jennifer, and my children, Nicholas and Kaitlyn, enabling them to reach their highest potential. I envision a life where my commitment to spirituality, family, health, entrepreneurship, and career growth not only benefits me but also enriches the lives of those around me."

## Values
